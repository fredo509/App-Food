<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Food App] `[Ruby On Rails]` <a name="about-project"></a>

The Ruby on Rails Food application exemplifies the MVC architecture and leverages the Devise gem for authentication and the CanCanCan gem for authorization. Demonstrating the robust capabilities of Ruby on Rails, this app seamlessly interacts with a database to deliver an impressive user experience.

With a focus on food-related functionalities, the app offers a comprehensive view interface encompassing foods, recipes, and inventories. Through this interface, users are empowered to perform a range of actions. They can effortlessly add, delete, or edit items, provided they possess the necessary authorization based on their assigned role within the system.

The app also introduces a unique feature: the ability to generate a shopping list. By activating a modal and selecting items from the inventory, users can craft a personalized shopping list tailored to their requirements.

Furthermore, the app supports enhanced sharing capabilities. Users have the option to make their recipes public, extending access to all users — even those who aren't authenticated. This inclusivity encourages an exchange of culinary knowledge and ideas, fostering a collaborative environment within the app's user community.

In summary, the Ruby on Rails Food app is a showcase of the dynamic potential of the Ruby on Rails framework. By adhering to the MVC pattern and integrating authentication, authorization, and innovative features, it seamlessly orchestrates database interactions and provides users with a feature-rich platform for managing food-related content and enhancing their culinary experiences.
